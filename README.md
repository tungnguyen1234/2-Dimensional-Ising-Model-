Abstract: The topic of ferromagnetism has received great attentions for research and developments in science due to its exotic 
properties and many applica- tions for generators, transformers, telephones, loudspeakers, and magnetic recording devices. 
Among the researches for this topic, one of the most fundamental pioneer model comes from the work of the Ising model by 
Wilhelm Lenz. As the model can be translatable with students that took electrodynamics and thermal physics, this topic has 
been widely taught and researched by undergraduate faculties and students interested in ther- mal physics and electrodynamics. 
One of those undergraduate concepts that we chose for this report is mostly taken from the book ”Thermal Physics” by 
Daniel V. Schroeder. From this book, we aim to explore the ferromagnetism in the Ising Model from the programming and 
computational aspects. From here, we considered the effectiveness of our coding and matching results with the theoretical model.
